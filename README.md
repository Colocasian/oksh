# rish

A shell implementation, written in C.

## Building

To build the project, run:

```shell
./configure
make
```

And a binary `rish` will be built in `src` directory. If you want to install the
application to the specified prefix (default: `/usr/local`), run `make install`.
To see all available configuration options, run `./configure --help`.
